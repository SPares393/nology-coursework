Object oriented programming challenge.

Brief: "Create a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet.
Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced.
Once an alien ships points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and can’t be hit again. The
game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed."
